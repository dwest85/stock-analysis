# stock-analysis

# Overview of Project
To help Steve quickly pull ticker volume and return information from several different stocks, automating the fetching of the data, while also increasing the efficiency of the runtime for the subroutine.

# Results
![2017 results]()
![2018 results]()
Based on the results between the 2017 and 2018 stocks, the data compiled shows that the selected stocks performed much better in 2017 than in 2018. This subroutine macro can be used on stocks from other datasets to help cross-analyze the volume and returns.

![loopingticker]()
An example of the code used to loop through all rows, comparing the tickerIndex to the cell value. This helps create the necessary values for tickerStartingPrices and tickerEndingPrices.

# Summary
1. "What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?"
Refactoring code can significantly help with the design and readability of the code, making it easier to use with other datasets or to re-shape into a different use completely.
Also, refactoring code can help with the overall runtime and memory used to run the code, which is very beneficial for achieving absolute productivity.

2. "How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?"
These advantages apply to our current code by making it more adaptable for future datasets, as well as improving the overall runtime. Some disadvantages to refactoring code would be increased man-power hours spent on tweaking the original code.
